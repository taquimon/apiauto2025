## Validations

Why Is API Response Validation Important?

Validating API responses is essential for the following reasons:

* **Consistency:** Automated validation ensures that APIs return data in a consistent format, minimizing discrepancies.
* **Accuracy:** By checking response accuracy, developers can catch data errors early, reducing downstream issues.
* **Security:** Proper validation prevents unauthorized access and detects unusual response patterns, maintaining data security.
